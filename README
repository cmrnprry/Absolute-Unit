Absolute Unit was made in less than 48 hours at the Berklee Game Jam. It was a four person team, two sound designers/composers, on artist and one programmer.

It was made using RPG Maker VX Ace, which I had owned for a while but never used. It was the first time I had made a game during a game jam where it was both functional and finished!

You play as a skinny dog named Boofus who doesn't have an owner. He sees that all the other happy dogs with their owners are a little chubby. He decides to embark on a quest to get all the treats to become an abslute unit and get an owner.
